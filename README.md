This project is meant to be a super simple site that developers and others can use to showcase themselves and their work. It is html/css/javascript and depends on bootstrap 4 and fontawesome. 

Take a look at config.js to see which variables are configurable.

Extend the site to fit your needs by adding more cards. https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/card/
