This project is meant to be a super simple site that developers and others can use to showcase themselves and their work. It is built using HTML/CSS/Javascript, and it depends on external resources bootstrap 4 and fontawesome. 

[Demo](https://jmoujaes.github.io/simple-dev-portfolio/)

Take a look at js/config.js to see which variables are configurable.

Extend the site to fit your needs by adding more cards. Bootstrap documentation on cards: https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/card/
